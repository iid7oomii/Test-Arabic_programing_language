# Abjad Session Farewell Generator

A simple, interactive web application designed to generate personalized farewell messages using the syntax of **Abjad** (an Arabic programming language).

This tool was built to be used at the end of technical sessions/workshops to engage attendees, allowing them to generate a code snippet with their name and run it on the Abjad interpreter.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Enter Name:** The user inputs their name into the text field.
2. **Generate Code:** Upon clicking the button, the app dynamically constructs a code snippet in the Abjad language.
3. **Run & Test:** The user copies the code and is directed to the Abjad Interpreter to run it and see the output.

## 📝 Code Example

If the user enters the name `Mohammed`, the tool generates the following Abjad code:

```abjad
متغير مقطع رسالة = "نورتنا يا Mohammed ونشوفك المره القادمة"؛
اكتب(رسالة)؛
